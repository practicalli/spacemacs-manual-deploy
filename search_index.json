So it only loads in those features you need.\n\nThe rest of this section goes into more details as to why you would choose Spacemacs for your developer life, including:\n\neasy to use configuration using layers (rather than configuring individual packages)\nClojure layer provides full CIDER &amp; clj-refactor support\n\n\nEasily discover commands with mnemonic menu\nHelm narrowing &amp; completion\nSimplifying keybindings with multiple states\nTransient State menus for repetitive actions\n\n\nStructured editing with Smartparens and Lisp mode\nFast project &amp; file management with Projectile, simple window &amp; buffer management too\n\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"why-spacemacs/extensive-language-support.html":{"url":"why-spacemacs/extensive-language-support.html","title":"Extensive Language Support","body":"Extensive Language Support\n Icons or graphics for all the languages supported\nAll the languages...\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n   \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n     \n      \n        \n      \n    \n     \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n      \n    \n  \n \n     \n      \n    \n     \n      \n    \n  \n      \n    \n  \n \n     \n      \n    \n     \n      \n    \n  \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHtml Layer\nHTML\nCSS\nJavaScript Layer\nJavaScript\nReact Layer\nReact\nPython &amp; Django Layers\nRuby &amp; Rails Layers\nC C++ Layer\ncsharp layers\nelixr\nelm\nhaskel\njava\nscala\npurescript\nracket\nrust\nscala\nscheme\nyml\nsql\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"why-spacemacs/layers.html":{"url":"why-spacemacs/layers.html","title":"Simple Layers","body":"Simple Layers and Configuration\nMost language support and many other amazing features can be added to Emacs from many hundreds of packages created by the community. It does seem that there is a package for just about everything you want to do.\nSpacemacs uses Layers that organise these packages and the configuration to make them work seamlessly together.  For example, the Clojure layer is composed of 9 different packages that you would otherwise have to know about and install and then get them to work together with a bit of configuration code.  Layers make things very simple, requiring only one word to be added to the Spacemacs configuration file.\n Add commic strip about thiswas this xkd or something similar... the one where butterflies flap their wings and a storm is created the other side of the world.\nSpacemacs provides a well tested configuration file called ~/.spacemacs that provides lots of sensible defaults and makes customising your experience very easy.

For example, if you are adding a large layer or multiple layers and pulling in a number of packages.\nUnless its a small change, then restart Emacs with SPC q r\nAdding a Layer\nSimply open the ~/.spacemacs file and add the name of the layer you want in the section dotspacemacs-configuration-layers.  Some layers also take additional configuration in the form of variables in the layer definition.\nSee the Spacemacs documentation for a list of layers or open the help in Spacemacs SPC h SPC to list all the layers, pressing RET on a layer name to read about it.\n\n  Notes for existing Emacs usersIf you have configured Emacs before, you can consider the .spacmacs file as a replacement for the init.el file you would otherwise use to define your Emacs configuration.Installing packages via the packages-list-packages method is ignored by Spacemacs.  Any packages installed in this way will be ignored.If no layer exists for a package, you can use a package without a layerYou can add what ever elisp you like to the dotspacemacs/user-config section of the ~/.spacemacs configuration file.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"why-spacemacs/clojure-layer.html":{"url":"why-spacemacs/clojure-layer.html","title":"Clojure Layer","body":"Clojure Layer Overview\nThe Clojure layer provides a range of tools and full languages support for the Clojure functional programming language.\nThe Clojure layer supports Leiningen, Boot and Clojure CLI tools.\nThe layer is a collection of Emacs packages and curated configuration to ensure all those packages work well together in Spacemacs.

You can also move symbols and expressions around without risking unmatched parenthesis or other structure characters (using slurp, barf, wrap, unwrap, etc.).\n Structured Editing SectionRead the Structured editing section for a detailed guide to using Lisp mode, Smartparens, Paredit and Evil mode to manage your Clojure (and elsip) code.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"why-spacemacs/project-file-navigation.html":{"url":"why-spacemacs/project-file-navigation.html","title":"Project & File navigation","body":"Project and File Navigation\nProjectile provides easy project management and navigation.

You can also pin this to the start menu or task bar.\n Access to common Unix toolsCommand line tools, such as diff, are used by Emacs.  To have these command line tools available in Windows, install Emacs as above but then run emacs from a Unix shell such as GitBash.\nMSYS2\nInstall Emacs (64bits build) with the following:\npacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-emacs\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"before-you-start/install-clojure.html":{"url":"before-you-start/install-clojure.html","title":"Install Clojure","body":"Install Clojure\n Install a Java runtime environment, preferably version 1.8 and Leiningen to create, manage and run Clojure projects.\nJava\n  Check you have a Java runtime on your system path by typing the following in a terminal window:\njava -version\n\nIf Java is not found, please install it from Oracle or OpenJDK.\nJava may also be available via your operating systems package manger, for example on Ubuntu / Debian systems this would be installed via:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre\nLeiningen\nLeiningen is the most commonly used build automation tool used to manage Clojure projects.

This does not scroll the cursor unless the cursor hist the top or bottom of the window, in which case the cursor stays at that window boundry.\nC-y - scroll down\nC-e - scroll text up\nInserting a character multiple times\nIn Vim normal mode (yellow) type the number of times to repeat the character followed immediately followed by i, then the character or word you want to reapeat.

You can easily jump between expressions as they are defined unambiguously.\nThis well defined structure makes it trivial to move expressions around, giving you a simple way to refactor the internals of your code.\nSmartparens - writing structured text\nSpacemacs uses smart parens to help you write structured code really fast and also move expressions around.  Smart parens is a newer implementation of the classic paredit package.\nSPC SPC sp-cheet-sheet will list all the smartparens commands available.\n\nTODO Check out https://github.com/expez/evil-smartparens as it seems to provide the desired smartparens behaviour for Vim normal mode that I get in Emacs mode.\n\nLisp mode - manipulating structured text\nSpacemacs includes an Evil lisp-state, SPC k . for refactoring Lisp base languages like Clojure.  In this lisp-state you can use single character commands to move symbols and expressions around without risking unmatched parenthesis or other structure characters.\nVim Alternatives\nAlthough it is not structural editing, in Vim mode you can delete to a particular character.

For example I could not delete any paren of the following expression until I delete the content of the expression (def brackets &quot;They are the best&quot;)\nI would have to delete the contents of this def expression before I could remove the open or close paren.\n\n  \n\n\nCommands Highlights\nSmartparens package provides additional functions for navigating and manipulating strictly balanced expressions.

See YASnippet in action in this Emacs Yasnippet video.\nTo use a specific snippet simply type the alias and press M-/.\nFor example, in html-mode typing div and pressing M-/ expands to &lt;div id=&quot;▮&quot; class=&quot;▯&quot;&gt;▯&lt;/div&gt; and places the cursor so you can type in the id name, then TAB to the class name, finally TAB to the contents of the div.\nYou can also combine yasnippets with autocompletion select snippets from the autocompletion menu.\nSpacemacs has lots of snippets for most of the languages and modes it supports.

Simply typing in a snippet name and pressing M-/ or using M-x yas-expand gives you the full text &amp; code structure from the snippet template.\nFor example, if you are defining a new function in Clojure then type defn and press M-/ to expand to the full definition structure, including all parens.  Then use TAB to move through the structure to complete the name, doc-string, arguments and behaviour of the function.\nLets look at the built-in snippets that come with the Clojure layer in Spacemacs (and should be the default in Emacs YASnippet package).\n\nIts easy to wrtie your own snippets for Clojure or any other language you use with Spacemacs / Emacs\n\nWhere do Snippets fit in\nThere are several ways to speed up typing your Clojure code, Leiningen Templates, autocompletion, clj-refactor and YASnippets.\nSnippets are a great way to create much of the common code structures you typically write as you are developing your code.  The snippets I use the most are defn, let, ifl and for.\nSome of the snippets are made redundant by other Clojure layer features in Spacemacs.  For example, when I create a new file then the namespace is automatically added, so I rarely use the ns snippet.  I also use clj-refactor which takes care of adding require statements for me, so the require snippet is rarely used.\n\nNote: Smartparens does not work when you are completing an expanded snippet the first time.  However, as soon as you tab out of the end of the snippet then smartparens works again.  I havent determined if this is simply a missing config or some conflict between YASnippets &amp; Smartparens.\n\nDefault snippets for Clojure\nThe snippets that are available in Spacemacs can be found in the yasnippet github repository or in the ~/.emacs.d/elpa/yasnippet-20160501.1841/snippets/clojure-mode directory on your laptop (when yasnippet package is updated then name of that directory will change).\nAll the current snippets for Clojure mode are in the following table, indicating which tab stops they have.\n\n\n\nSnippet\nDescription\nTab Stops\n\n\n\n\nbench\nbenchmark an expression, using the time function\nbody\n\n\nbp\ndepreciated: break point in swank\n\n\n\ndef\ndef expression\nN/A\n\n\ndefm\ndefmacro expression, with name, doc-string, arguments &amp; body tabstops\nname, docstring, args, body\n\n\ndefn\ndefn expression, with name, doc-string, arguments &amp; body tabstops\nname, docstring, args, body\n\n\ndefr\ndefrecord\ndocstring, object, args, body\n\n\ndeft\ndeftype\ndocstring, object, args, body\n\n\ndoseq\ndoseq\nname, body\n\n\nfn\nfn - anonymous function\nname, body\n\n\nfor\nfor\ncondition, body\n\n\nif\nif\ncondition, body\n\n\nifl\nif-let - if true, bind a local name\nbinding, body\n\n\nimport\nimport java library\nlibrary name\n\n\nis\nis - clojure test assertion\nvalue, expected\n\n\nlet\nlet - bind a local name to a value\nname, value, body\n\n\nmap\nmap\nfn, col, col\n\n\nmap.lambda\nmap with anonymous function #()\nfn, body\n\n\nmdoc\nmetadata docstring\ndocstring\n\n\nns\nns - expression with the current namespace inserted automatically\nN/A\n\n\nopts\ndestructuring a map with :keys, :or for default values, :as for entire vector\n:key binding, or defaults, :as binding\n\n\npr\nprn - print function\nstring/value\n\n\nprint\nprintln - print function\nstring/value\n\n\nreduce\nreduce - reduce expression with an anonymous function\nargs, body\n\n\nrequire\n:require expression with library and alias\nlibrary, alias\n\n\ntest\ndeftest expression\ntest description, value/expected\n\n\ntry\ntry &amp; catch expression\ntry expression, exception name, body\n\n\nuse\ndepreciated: use require instead\n\n\n\nwhen\nwhen\nwhen expression, body\n\n\nwhenl\nwhen-let - local binding on when condition\nbinding, body\n\n\n\n\nHint: The above table was created in Emacs markdown mode by enabling the minor mode: orgtbl-mode.

Under this directory structure you should create a folder named after the relevant mode for your snippets, eg markdown-mode.  Inside this mode folder, create files whos names are based on the snippet alias you wish.\nSo for a work in progress snipped called wip in markdown mode I created ~/.emacs.d/private/snippets/markdown-mode/wip file.\nYou need to load this new snippet into Spacemacs by either restarting or using the command M-x yas-load-snippet-buffer command in the buffer of the new snippet you have just written.  Ths snippet with then work within any markdown mode buffer.\nManaging your snippets\nAlthough the private snippets directory is easy to use, it is not under version control.  So although its not over-riddend by Spacemacs it also means your private snippets are not backed up anywhere.\nIf you use the ~/.spacemacs.d/snippets/modename-mode/ directory structure for your snippets then you can version them with Git or similar versioning tools.\nHow to write a snippet\nEach snippet template is contained in its own file, named after the alias of the snippet.  So a snippet called wip will be in a filename wip, in a directory named after the relevant Emacs mode.\nThe basic structure of a snippet template is:\n#name : FullNameOfSnippet (not the alias name, the full name shows in autocompletion menu)\n#contributor: John Stevenson &lt;john@jr0cket.co.uk&gt;\n# --\nAdd the content you want to replace the snippet name with when it expands\nThe content can be anything, simple text or more usefully a code strucuture with placeholders\nExample: Simple text replacement\nI use markdown mode for writing a lot of content, especially for technical workshops.  As I am developing these workshops its useful to highlight which sections are still work in progress.  Rather than type the common message I use, I&#39;ve created a simple snippet called wip.\n#name : WorkInProgress\n#contributor: John Stevenson &lt;john@jr0cket.co.uk&gt;\n# --\n&gt; **Fixme** work in progress\nWhen you expand this snippet with M-/ then the snippet name is replaced by the content.\nExample: Using tab stops\nLets look at an existing snippet called form in the html-mode.  This expands into a html form, but also helps you jump from method, id, action and content.\n#contributor : Jimmy Wu &lt;frozenthrone88@gmail.com&gt;\n#name :&lt;form method=&quot;...&quot; id=&quot;...&quot; action=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;/form&gt;\n# --\n&lt;form method=&quot;$1&quot; id=&quot;$2&quot; action=&quot;$3&quot;&gt;\n  $0\n&lt;/form&gt;\nThis snippet is the same as the simpler example, except we have added tab stops using the $ sign and a number.  When you expand this snippet, the snippet name is replaced by the content as usual but the cursor is placed at the first tab stop $1.  Each time you press TAB you move to the next tab stop.\n$0 is our exit point from the snippet, so pressing TAB reverts to the usual behaviour outside of YASnippet.\nFor more examples talk a look at the Emacs YASnippet video tutorial or the blogs: Adding YASnippets snippets &amp; Snippet expansion with YASnippet\nTesting your snippets\nOnce you have written your snippet, you can quickly test it using M-x yas-tryout-snippet.  This opens a new empty buffer in the appropriate major mode and inserts the snippet so you can then test it with M-/.\nIf you just want to try the snippet in an existing buffer, then use M-x yas-load-snippet-buffer to load this new snippet into the correct mode.  M-x yas-load-snippet-buffer does exactly the same except it kills the snippet buffer (prompting to save first if neccessary).\n\nThere are no default keybindings for these commands in Spacemacs, so you could create a binding under C-o, for example C-o C-s t to try a snippet and C-o C-s l to load a snippet.\n\nAdding yas-snippets to autocompletion in Spacemacs\nBy adding the autocompletion layer in Spacemacs the YASnippets can be shown in the autocompletion menu as you type.\nBy default, snippets are not shown in the auto-completion popup, so set the variable auto-completion-enable-snippets-in-popup to t.\n(setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers\n              &#39;((auto-completion :variables\n                                 auto-completion-enable-snippets-in-popup t)))\n\nSummary\nFind out more about YASnippets and autocompletion from the Github repository for Spacemacs autocompletion layer.

Any test library\ncan implement it if so desired, and therefore leverage cider-test. For\ninstance, test.check does this, and\ncider-test handles defspec just like deftest.\nAs a test framework author, supporting the built-in clojure.test machinery\n(and hence cider-test) is pretty straightforward:\n\nAssoc each test fn as :test metadata on some var. These are what get run.\nImplement the clojure.test/report multimethod to capture the test results.\n\nThe test.check library is a good example here.

This will make a public gist out of marked files (or if you use with a prefix, it will make private gists)\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"debugging/":{"url":"debugging/","title":"Debugging","body":"Debugging\nReferences\nhttp://endlessparentheses.com/conditional-breakpoints-in-the-cider-debugger.html\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"literate-programming/org-mode.html":{"url":"literate-programming/org-mode.html","title":"Org-mode","body":"Org-mode\nLiterate programming is supported by a Org-mode, a feature rich way of creating documentation and managing tasks.\nSimple open or create a new file with a .org filename extension.\nFor example, if you want to write a guide to your project, you could create an org-mode file called user-guide.org.

Its goal is to provide a nice set of features operating on a project level without introducing external dependencies (when feasible). For instance - finding project files has a portable implementation written in pure Emacs Lisp without the use of GNU find (but for performance sake an indexing mechanism backed by external commands exists as well).\nProjectile tries to be practical - portability is great, but if some external tools could speed up some task substantially and the tools are available, Projectile will leverage them.\nThis library provides easy project management and navigation. The concept of a project is pretty basic - just a folder containing special file. Currently git, mercurial, darcs and bazaar repos are considered projects by default. So are lein, maven, sbt, scons, rebar and bundler projects. If you want to mark a folder manually as a project just create an empty .projectile file in it.

I have written a beginner&#39;s guide to spacemacs for academic writing and a cheat sheet that you might find useful: https://ontologicalblog.wordpress.com/2016/10/14/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-spacemacs-for-academic-writing/\n\nAgenda files\n\n(with-eval-after-load &#39;org (setq org-agenda-files\n                              &#39;(&quot;c:/Users/USERNAME/Dropbox/Notes/&quot;)))\nworking with buffers\nWhen you want a window to stay put, use SPC w t. It calls the function spacemacs/toggle-current-window-dedication.\nI use it to make sure REPL and shell windows don&#39;t accidentally get taken over by new buffers.\nWhen I start up the spacemacs buffer shows a list of recent files. Is there a command to open everything in that list?\nquicknir @quicknir 02:25\nSPC f r\nfiles recent\nso, with helm you can mark multiple things and act on all of them\nUse C-j and C-k to move the cursor up and down in the list of recent files.\nUse C-SPC to mark individual files or mark every listed file with M-a and then hitting enter should open everything\nScrolling In vim mode\nC-y - scroll down the buffer so you can see more text at the top of the buffer\nC-e - scroll up the buffer so you can see more text further down\nC-l - toggle between centering the current line, moving the current line to the top of the buffer and the original position\n? How to jump to a line number or jump the cursor a number of lines\nManipulating case of text\nCase Conversion Commands\nEmacs has commands for converting either a single word or any arbitrary range of text to upper case or to lower case.\nM-l\nConvert following word to lower case (downcase-word).\nM-u\nConvert following word to upper case (upcase-word).\nM-c\nCapitalize the following word (capitalize-word).\nC-x C-l\nConvert region to lower case (downcase-region).\nC-x C-u\nConvert region to upper case (upcase-region).\nM-l (downcase-word) converts the word after point to lower case, moving past it. Thus, repeating M-l converts successive words. M-u (upcase-word) converts to all capitals instead, while M-c (capitalize-word) puts the first letter of the word into upper case and the rest into lower case. All these commands convert several words at once if given an argument. They are especially convenient for converting a large amount of text from all upper case to mixed case, because you can move through the text using M-l, M-u or M-c on each word as appropriate, occasionally using M-f instead to skip a word.\nWhen given a negative argument, the word case conversion commands apply to the appropriate number of words before point, but do not move point. This is convenient when you have just typed a word in the wrong case: you can give the case conversion command and continue typing.\nIf a word case conversion command is given in the middle of a word, it applies only to the part of the word which follows point. (This is comparable to what M-d (kill-word) does.) With a negative argument, case conversion applies only to the part of the word before point.\nThe other case conversion commands are C-x C-u (upcase-region) and C-x C-l (downcase-region), which convert everything between point and mark to the specified case. Point and mark do not move.\nThe region case conversion commands upcase-region and downcase-region are normally disabled. This means that they ask for confirmation if you try to use them. When you confirm, you may enable the command, which means it will not ask for confirmation again. See Disabling.\nc\nTerminology\nFunctions\nFunction refers to the thing that you are calling when you hit a key or series of keys. For example j in normal modeis mapped to the function evil-next-line. In elisp these usually look like strings of hyphenated words. spc spc opens helm M-x and lets you search for functions by name and execute them. Note that functions may also be refered to as sexps (symbolic expressions).\nBuffers\nBuffers are like tabs in your browser. You open them from files on your computer instead of from the internet, and they stay open until you close them. Hit spc b b to see a searchable list of your open buffers, and recently opened buffers. spc b B opens a list of buffers organized by major mode. spc b d deletes the buffer you are currently in. As you can most the spc b commands are related to buffers. But buffers arent necessarily just files you open, they can also be generated by emacs (like the helm mini buffer (spc b b) you use to search buffers) to do useful things.\nThe Mode Line\nAt the bottom of the window, you will see the mode line. Its got some handy information in it. From left to right it shows you:\nYour window number. The color indicates what evil mode you are in (normal, insert, etc)\nA little * indicator if your file has been modified since it has been saved.\nBuffer size.\nBuffer name (same as file name if you have opened from file).\nMajor mode.\nMinor modes.\nOn the far right is info about where you are in a buffer. Move around whth hjkl and watch it if you dont get it at first.\nMajor Modes\nThis is how emacs organizes important sets of functionality. Each buffer will have one major mode at a time. It can customize anything about emacs so that it suits the buffer you are working with. There is a mode for editing C#, a mode for editing latex, a mode for viewing files (dired-mode), a mode for searching (helm-major-mode), a mode for emulating a terminal (term-mode). You can see what major mode you are in at the bottom of each buffer in your mode line. Usually this is automatically set depending on which buffer you are in. Major modes specific functions are on the , key (also spc m).\nMinor Modes\nMinor modes are smaller sets of custom behavior that can work together. A major mode will automatically set a bunch of relevant minor modes, but you can toggle them with spc t. For example spc t n toggles a minor mode for line numbers. You can hover over the symbols in the modeline with your mouse to see what minor mode each represents. spc h d m (help describe mode) opens a comprehensive list of your active minor modes. Move your cursor to one and hit enter to get more information.\nSide Note: The information opens in a split buffer titled help. Many of these buffers that are meant to be temporary can be closed quickly with q.\nLayers\nEverything so far (except specific key bindings) applies to emacs in general. Layers, however, are a spacemacs specific term. Layers are meant to be a simple way for you to customize your configuration by adding only one line to your .spacemacs file. See the list to see what are available. Check out the latex layer for example.\nThe .spacemacs file\nHit spc f e d (file emacs dotfile) to open this file. This is where you can customize everything. Find the dotspacemacs-configuration-layers line. You can use / in normal mode to start searching for it and enter when you have it. Add latex in that list. It should look like this:\ndotspacemacs-configuration-layers &#39;(\n  latex\n  other-layer\n  other-layer)\nNow spacemacs will load that layer on startup for you, which includes a major mode for editing latex and a bunch of commands. You can now either restart emacs, or hit spc f e R(file emacs reload) to reload your config. Now if you hit spc f f (file find) and open a latex file you should have some syntax highlighting and latex specific commands on your , key.\nWhy Vim ?\nPositives\n\nCut the Mouse - One of the main wins for Vim has always been that it is an editor that lets you keep your hands on the keyboard. Reaching for the mouse slows you down, and while I never really had a problem with that in the past (I spend more time thinking and reading than I do writing code), now that I’ve experienced 2 months with my hands on the keyboard I do find myself noticing (annoyingly) when I am forced to reach for the mouse.\n\nFast Navigation - Moving around inside files in most windows editors involves a lot of home/end/up/down arrow key. Having search and tag based navigation makes getting around within a file much faster. Finding the right file is also easier with the commandt plugin, influenced by Textmate on the Mac, this fuzzy file finder is not typically available in traditional windows editors (last time I looked)\n\nSplit Windows - Splitting windows into panes and navigating around them is a killer feature that I use all the time to see multiple files at once, or multiple areas of the same file at once. In the past I used tabs heavily, but I now prefer split panes that I can manage without reaching for the mouse.\n\n\nNegatives\nHJKL - Sorry, call me a heretic but I just cannot get used to using these keys for up/down/left/right. 20+ years of using the arrow keys is completely and utterly embedded in my brain. Besides, I’m pretty sure J (down) and K (up) are bass-ackwards. Western languages, and presumably most programming languages, read from TOP LEFT to BOTTOM RIGHT so shouldn’t UP be next to LEFT and DOWN be next to RIGHT ??? I know I could remap the keys, but plugins that follow similar patterns would also have to be remapped and I just could not get used to it.\n\nMode Struggles - The modal nature of Vim is both a blessing and a curse. Its the feature that allows us to keep our hands on the keyboards without the wrist breaking key combo’s of Emacs but its also far too easy to forget which mode you are in and start typing code only to discover you just executed 5 random commands. The people who recommend you ESC constantly back into command mode are absolutely correct. You have to shift your thinking into being primarily command based with short sharp bursts of INSERT.\n\nBreaking Windows - One of the side effects of the modal nature of vim is that it trains you to constantly hit ESCAPE to go back to command mode…. but when you do this in more traditional windows apps its quite possible you will end up dismissing a dialog while you are in the middle of typing! How frustrating! I hit this mostly when using Tortoise SVN for my code commits.\n\nDisappointing Plugins - Whilst some plugins are awesome, some are surprisingly disappointing. While I was really looking forward to them, the following plugins just didn’t get as much use as I expected session (doesn’t work well with NERDTree or quickfix window), taglist (doesn’t work well with dynamic languages - at the moment I use primarily Ruby and Javascript), Conque Shell - (nice idea, but doesn’t feel natural, just easier to use :shell or have another terminal open)\nEffort vs Reward\nOk. So I have a theory…\nVim proponents will tell you that the effort you spend learning vim will pay dividends in the long run once you know how to use it properly. After 60 days I can say that I agree with that opinion.\nHowever, if I spent this much effort learning any editor I think it would pay dividends in the long run. The difference is that Vim forces you to go through this pain, whilst other editors work ‘out the box’ and so most programmers are not inclined to learn the power of those editors.\nFor example, I think UltraEdit, TextMate, even Visual Studio are pretty good editors, but since they all pretty much just work out of the box, its easy to ignore their advanced features and not spend the time customizing and configuring them.\nI wonder if I spent 60 days really learning UltraEdit if I couldn’t get the same positives I described here ? Hmmm, a future article maybe?\nConclusion\nI’m still using Vim after 60 days, and I plan to continue using it for the foreseeable future as long as I can keep taking a little time here and there to dig deeper, customize a bit more, learn how to overcome the negatives and build upon the positives.\nVim seems to be so powerful that I could be learning it forever. Here’s a list of some of the things I want to spend time on in the future.\nMovement - I need to learn more code related movement commands like % match\nSessions - Both sessions.vim and sessionman.vim seem to struggle with NERDTree and the quickfix window\nCut &amp; Paste - I need to learn more about vim registers so I can manage my cut &amp; paste better, errr, sorry, I mean yank &amp; put\nUndo &amp; Redo - I think I spend too much time in insert mode so when I undo it tends to be more than I’d like\nHJKL - Maybe I should remap to swap the J and K keys and try again!\nMore Plugins - There are many more plugins I would like to take the time to check out, and perhaps build some of my own.\nprojectile\nSPC p p - switch to another project that spacemacs knows about\nranger\nA fast way to browse files and directories\nuse vim keybindings to navigate\nj / k -- up / down current directory\nl -- into the currently selected directory\nh -- up to parent directory\nq -- quit\nsome configuration to consider\n (ranger :variables\n         ranger-ignored-extensions &#39;(\n                                     &quot;mkv&quot; &quot;iso&quot; &quot;mp4&quot; &quot;avi&quot; &quot;mp4&quot; &quot;mkv&quot;\n                                     &quot;zip&quot; &quot;rar&quot; &quot;exe&quot; &quot;ps&quot; &quot;webm&quot; &quot;png&quot;\n                                     &quot;jpg&quot; &quot;jpeg&quot; &quot;tif&quot; &quot;tiff&quot; &quot;ics&quot; &quot;dmg&quot;\n                                     &quot;swf&quot; &quot;gz&quot; &quot;m4a&quot;)\n         ranger-max-preview-size 4  ;; Megabyte\n         ranger-cleanup-eagerly t\n         )\niedit-mode\nSPC s e\n\nBlog: http://nexusstar.name/hackpads/spacemacs-iedit-mode-cheat-sheat/\n\niedit-mode (aka interactive-edit-mode) gives you the power to edit instances of the same text string in a buffer. It’s quite similar to multiple cursors, although if you’re used to working with multiple cursors, it’s likely you’ll prefer that.\nIEdit defaults to selecting all matches, and then allows you to reduce and expand the matches in various ways, so the workflow is in the opposite direction.\nI use iedit often as a quick interactive replace all, and multiple cursors for anything in between that and more complicated regexp search replace.\nIn conjunction with wgrep-mode (that is a writeable grep mode, which works with most grep alternative tools as well) iedit-mode can become a poweful way to edit a string across many files and review the changes before you save them.\nTo install it use M-x package-install iedit\nOnce installed you can start it with C-; (M-x iedit-mode)\nNote, this doesn’t work in a terminal so in that case I’d bind it to C-c ;\nSpacemacs has a binding for IEdit mode on it’s SPACE leader (SPC s e)\nMultiple cursor options in spacemacs\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/spacemacs/comments/4641zt/how_the_heck_do_i_use_multicursor_support/\ngeneral stuff\nFrom: http://blog.christopher-atkins.com/more-spacemacs\nInter-file Navigation SPC b b open Helm mini-buffer SPC f f Helm find files, is less useful than SPC p f Projectile find files SPC p p Projectile find project\nUsing the Ranger layer (file manager) invoked using SPC a r (applications ranger) Consier using Unimpaired layer (tpope quick cycling) Consider using Fasd layer to complement Fasd\nIntra-file Navigation SPC s s SWOOP! opens a copy of the buffer then elides lines that don’t match the search you type, allowing you to navigate the top buffer by selecting lines in the swoop buffer\nWindow navigation SPC  navigate numbered windows Eyebrowse layer allows SPC W then a number to create/navigate to a new workspace with Eybrwose working you can using Vim’s gt and gT to\nEditing Select some text, then s  will surround with  iedit, get a selection (the whole current symbol by default) then SPC s e to enter iedit mode, allowing you to edit all the matched things at once SPC ; ; toggle line comment Diacritics in Emacs C-x 8 &#39; e to creates é\nHelp SPC h d invokes “help describe”, providing access to multipe ways of find help SPC f e h is canonical spacemacs help\nChecking SPC t s turns on syntax checking\nFuture layers to explore OrgMode + Capture mode Abbrev mode\nEditorconfig layer to manage things like indent and such\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "}}}
