# Sample Spacemacs Configuration

> Customisations made to the standard Spacemacs install are contained in the Github repository [Spacemacs configuration](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config)
>
> Either [browse the repository online](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config) or use your favorite git client or the following git clone command:
>
> `git clone https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config.git`
>
> The above command creates a new directory called `spacemacs-config` that contains the configuration examples from this book, all in one place.
>
> You can use **ediff** in Spacemacs to compare your configuration files with the examples.
