# Classic Emacs structural editing

Developers using Emacs and Cider will probably be familiar with [paredit]() for their structural editing needs.

Paredit is a very nice library, however, it was only created for Clojure / Lisp languages.

Spacemacs uses [Smartparens](smartparens.html) which provides structural editing for all languages, so paredit is not required.

Paredit is however part of the Clojure layer in Spacemacs, although there are no keybindings defined.
