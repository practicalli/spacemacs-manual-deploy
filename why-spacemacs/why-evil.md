# Evil Vim Style Editing
Evil provide Vim style editing across all languages and modes in Emacs, simplifying the editing of files and keyboard shortcuts (keybindings)

Vim is a language for manipulating text files that goes far beyond editing files.  Learning this simple language removes cognitive load.  Speak vim and your fingers efficiently make the changes you want.

Multi-modal editing simplifies keybindings for everything, keeping your hands centered on the keyboard and increasing your productivity.  Multi-modal approach minimizing the need for  key chords that are slower and a common source of repetitive strain e.g. `C-c C-x M-j`
